Student Life Simulator Game
What My Game Is About
I made this game called Student Life Simulator where you play as a college student that is trying to balance everything without going crazy. You start with some basic statistics, such as GPA, study hours, social points, and stress level, then make two major decisions: what course load to take and which subject to focus on. The whole point is seeing if you can get through the semester with good grades but not completely burn out. I picked this theme because it's super relatable and basically what every college student deals with.
Branching Concepts and How to Run
My code uses if-elif-else chains for the main course selection (Light/Standard/Heavy) and nested if statements inside each choice that check your GPA to give different outcomes. I also used membership operators with in and not in to validate the study subject choice, logical operators like and and or for complex conditions, and even threw in an is not operator. To run it, just download the file and run python student_simulator.py in your terminal. The different endings depend on your final stress level and GPA - you can either burn out, have an excellent balanced semester, cruise with low stress, or just barely survive a tough semester.
AI Usage:
I used chat GPT to help me with this readme by correcting grammer and making sure everything is eloquent.
